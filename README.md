# Terminal

"Terminal in div" helper for developers and admins.
It ransforms the div element to the terminal which can display different information, or can be turned to read-write mode either directly in the terminal (like in normal command promts) or at the bottom command line while output is above it (AS400 style) - made just "for fun" but hope some guys can find it useful

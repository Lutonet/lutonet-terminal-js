# terminal-js

**Hello guys**

Thank you for your kind interest in this little class.
Please don't beat me much as it is my first published code in a bit modern JS

_Terminal-js_ should provide some nice functionalities helpful for website development and testing

The usage should be very universal and simple (importing the Class - create the instance and use it) and also highly customizable

Terminal supports two different modes

- **logger** is a read only terminal
- **as-400** terminal is divided to bottom command line and the display above it.

As an as-400 terminal it allows to read user input and get its value to use for triggering different functions
